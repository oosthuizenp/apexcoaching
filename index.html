          <p class="lead">This can be an about section.</p>
          <p>I work with individuals and teams to create positive and lasting change. My coaching
            is grounded in the understanding that we are what we repeatedly do, and my
            approach involves helping people to overcome challenges through attention, repetition
            and encouragement.</p>
          <p>This creates sound patterns of self-leadership through enhanced
            self-awareness. Not only does this help individuals to be fully present in their work
            and life, it also ultimately empowers them to take control of what guides and drives
            them. </p>

              “Craig is very relatable which helps me open up in our coaching sessions. I find Craig’s approach
              adaptable in creating practices and actions that seem like they are tailored for me. I never thought I
              would see a growth coach but after my sessions with Craig I would highly recommend the coaching process to
              anyone. Craig has helped me find measurable balance in my life through tools such as the balance wheel, as
              well as holding me accountable to the commitments I make and goals I set.
              I have thoroughly enjoyed our sessions and have seen the positive impact in my life, so much so, I have
              started practicing some of his practices, like the balance wheel with my fiancé.
              Overall, Craig is professional in his approach but blends a very real nuance to his coaching style – he
              understands where you are coming from and how to get you to be a better overall person.”

              “Craig is thoughtful, insightful and uplifting. He has unlocked strengths and abilities within me that I
              never knew I had locked away. His sessions challenge me to think outside the box and at times, he has
              given me a real sense of affirmation on certain actions or decisions I have made. He is wise and his
              mentorship has been of such great value in my work life and personal life. I have felt a real sense of
              growth and maturity since starting my coaching sessions with Craig. He is patient, and at times when I
              have felt emotional, he has put our work session plans aside and focused on me as an individual and walked
              me through these hard times to overcome them with strength and confidence.
              Having Craig as my life coach has empowered my confidence levels and the positivity, he has filled my life
              with is beyond all expectation. He has a gift and I am so blessed to have him as my coach!”

              "Craig’s coaching sessions from the start have been a great learning curve for me. They have helped me
              grow as a person not only in my personal life, but in my professional workplace as well. Craig has given
              me the confidence and tools to open up and have tough discussions with co-workers. He has taught me
              numerous coping skills and tools in the past few months. I now have better leadership skills, a better
              work/life balance, more focused on my goals and how to visualise them better and have learnt to deal with
              different personalities at work that I have in the past found difficult to deal with.
              Craig has been such an amazing coach, he is someone who is easy to connect with and makes you feel
              comfortable to talk about difficult subjects and willing to push yourself to figure out what works best
              for you. After finishing each session with Craig, I always feel uplifted and ready to go after the goals
              and plans I have put in place during the session."

              “The coaching sessions are very professional. They were very well-paced, and Craig respects my time and
              knows how to accommodate me in cases where the schedule cannot be kept. The one-hour sessions are just
              enough time to cover good ground without feeling like there’s too little time to tackle a topic. Every now
              and then Craig likes to introduce a neurological concept to validate or explain certain behaviours, this
              has helped me to better understand why and how I apply myself in certain situations. I can highly
              recommend his coaching sessions.”
